# Overview
This ASL Detector is a cutting-edge AI-powered application that uses computer vision and deep learning to recognize and classify American Sign Language (ASL) characters in real-time. This application utilizes the device's camera to capture hand landmarks and coordinates, which are then processed by a deep learning model to identify the corresponding ASL character.
